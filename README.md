## Research Aim
The aim of this research is to predict the stress aorta valve index (SAVI), which is a measure of aorta stenosis severity, based on CT images. This way, the assessment of aortic valve stenosis can move towards non-invasive measures. This research includes the implementation of a semi-automatic tool which allows the clinician to annotate landmarks of the aortic valves. Using these landmarks, a reconstruction of the aortic valves is automatically made. Using the reconstruction and the observed calcification of the aortic valve, a new calcium score is created. The calcium score is a revision of the Agatston score, where a certain weight is given to a calcium cluster based on the location of the cluster on the aortic valve. In addition, the aortic valve area (AVA) is assesses. The revised calcium score and the AVA are then used to predict the SAVI. 

The code in this repository is a step-for-step guide to create the semi-automatic implementation and showcases how the necessary code predicts the SAVI.
